# verilog_project

- Use Verilog/System Verilog for design
- Always write a Testbench for a design
- Testbench should be self-checking test bench
- Testbench should use task for sending input data to the DUT

## Verilog Designs with Testbenches
1. [Traffic Light Controller using FSM](https://github.com/sh7078/verilog_project/tree/main/traffic_light_controller_using_FSM)
2. [2-Stage pipeline processor](https://github.com/sh7078/verilog_project/tree/main/2-stage%20pipeline%20processor)
