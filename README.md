# verilog_project

- Use Verilog/System Verilog for design
- Always write a Testbench for a design
- Testbench should be self-checking test bench
- Testbench should use task for sending input data to the DUT

## Verilog Designs with Testbenches
1. Traffic Light Controller using FSM
2. 2-Stage pipeline processor
